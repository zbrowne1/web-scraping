# WEB SCRAPING
This is a python script that scrapes job listing from the website Fake JoB Websites. Additionally it extracts key job details. The extracted data is then structured into a Pandas Data Frame and saved as a CSV File.
I used Python, requests for fetching the webapage datta, Beautiful Soup for the webscraping and Pandas to structure and save the data.

## What is extracted?
The script extracts the following: Job Titles, Company Name, Location (City), Location(State), Date Posted, Day, Month, Day of the week and Year
### Running the scripts
The python script that was created and executed is called python webscraping.py. It was downloaded as a python file and uploaded into this Github repository.
This script printed a Pandas DataFrame containing the job details and a CSV file called realpython_jobs.csv was also generated.
